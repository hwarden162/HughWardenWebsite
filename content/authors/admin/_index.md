I am currently a PhD student in the Biomedical AI lab at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, part of the University of Edinburgh. Under the supervision of Ava Khamseh, I am using machine learning, cell painting and bioimage analysis techniques to understand the effects of cancer on cell morphology. Currently I am using a mixture of QuPath, Python and R to build an algorithm to automate the preprocessing of whole slide images for machine learning.

I have many other interests along side my PhD. I enjoy studying the applications of hypergraphs in real world analysis and developing packkages in R. I have combined these together and I am the author of the `rhype` package for representing hypergraphs in R. I am currently making improvements to the matrix based calculations in order to facilitate speedy handling of large hypergraphs. I hope that this will then be able to be used to calculate cellular redundancy in scRNA-seq data sets, to estimate heterogeneity of a cell population. I always enjoy feedback and input on my work so please get in touch.
