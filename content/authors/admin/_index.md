I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, which is a part of the University of Edinburgh. I am currently building an explainable AI pipeline to identify phenotypic changes associated with different mutations.

My other interests include practical applications of hypergraphs. I have written the `rhype` package for using hypergraphs in R. I am also writing the `hyperpy` for using hypergraphs in Python, available on my GitHub.
