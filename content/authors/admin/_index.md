I am currently a PhD student at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, part of the University of Edinburgh. Under the supervision of Ava Khamseh, I will be using machine learning and cell painting to look at how cancer, and other mutations, affect the morphology of cells. I am currently using Python and QuPath to build an automated preprocessing pipeline to extract pictures of cells from whole slide images for machine learning.

Along with my main PhD project, I also enjoy studying the applications of hypergraphs in real world analyses. I am the author of `rhype`, a package for the use of hypergraphs in R, available on CRAN. It is currently undergoing improvements to speed up the matrix based functionality for large hypergraphs. I always enjoy feedback and input on my work so please get in touch.
