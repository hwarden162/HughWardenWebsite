<p>This is a stub for an article currently in the process of being written. For the interested reader, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c94FkomS4Tw&amp;list=PLBY4G2o7DhF0iS7ifK1SahNscntxKojRE">this</a> is a brilliant mini course on the subject backed up by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory">spectral graph theory wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<p>The basics of the subject is that if you have a graph you can represent it using many different matrices. You can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices and depending on which matrix you use these can have special properties. In the end what this means is that you can represent a graph just as a set of numbers that will contain information about the graph.</p>
